# Brain-tumor-detection-and-localization-using-restnext-and-yolo
Project overview: This project aims to detect and localize the brain tumors using novel CNN architectures and object detection methods. Final outcome of this project is to build comprehensive model that can detect brain tumors, localize them and give a report to the user about detailing where the exact tumor is located.
